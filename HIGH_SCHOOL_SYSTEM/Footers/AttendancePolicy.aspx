    <h2>School Attendance Policy</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the school's official Attendance Policy page. The rules outlined here are designed to ensure that all students attend class regularly and are present for important academic activities.</p>
    
    <h3>General Attendance Guidelines</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Students are expected to attend school every day unless they have a valid excuse for their absence.</li>
        <li>Frequent absences can negatively impact academic performance and may result in disciplinary action.</li>
        <li>Attendance is recorded every day, and students are expected to be on time for all scheduled classes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Excused Absences</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Absences will be considered excused if the student provides a valid written explanation from a parent or guardian.</li>
        <li>Absences for medical reasons should be documented with a doctor's note.</li>
        <li>Religious holidays and family emergencies may be considered excused if the student provides adequate notice or documentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Unexcused Absences</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Absences without a valid reason or prior notice will be considered unexcused.</li>
        <li>Unexcused absences may result in disciplinary actions, including detention or a meeting with school administration.</li>
        <li>If a student is absent without an excuse for more than three consecutive days, a formal meeting will be required to discuss the situation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tardiness</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Students are expected to be in class on time. Tardiness disrupts the learning environment for both the individual student and their peers.</li>
        <li>Students who arrive late to class must report to the attendance office to check in.</li>
        <li>Repeated tardiness may lead to disciplinary actions, including detention or meetings with school administration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Make-Up Work</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Students who miss class due to an excused absence are responsible for catching up on missed work.</li>
        <li>Teachers will provide a reasonable amount of time for students to make up missed assignments and tests.</li>
        <li>Students should proactively reach out to teachers to obtain materials or assignments they missed during their absence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Consequences for Poor Attendance</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Excessive unexcused absences may result in academic penalties, including a lower grade for the course.</li>
        <li>Students with poor attendance may be subject to a parent-teacher meeting to discuss improvement strategies.</li>
        <li>If absenteeism continues without a valid excuse, further action may include suspension or a review of the student's continued enrollment at the school.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Final Remarks</h3>
    <p>Regular attendance is essential to student success. Students are encouraged to develop good habits early on to ensure consistent participation and academic achievement. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the attendance office.</p>
